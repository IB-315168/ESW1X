# Exercise 2.2

Implement a small program where you divide 7 with 3 and print the result. Also, find the remainder using the modulo operator. First, use intâ€™s as types variables to hold the values. Thentry to fix the problems observed using other datatypes.

## Solution

Modulo operator requires integers, therefore variables ```int a, b``` are defined as integers.

To get an accurate result of the division, cast operation ``` (double) 7/3``` to double.
